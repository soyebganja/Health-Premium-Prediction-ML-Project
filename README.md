## Overview
Healthcare costs are a significant concern for individuals and insurance companies. By leveraging machine learning techniques, this project predicts the insurance premium a customer might be charged based on their data. The predictions help insurers optimize pricing strategies and customers understand their potential costs.

---

## Features
- Data preprocessing, including handling missing values and outliers.
- Feature engineering for better model performance.
- Training and evaluation of multiple machine learning models.
- Hyperparameter tuning to optimize model accuracy.
- Visualization of key insights and model performance.

---

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python 3.8+
- **Libraries/Frameworks**:
  - Pandas, NumPy: Data manipulation and analysis
  - Scikit-learn: Model training and evaluation
  - Matplotlib, Seaborn: Data visualization
  - Streamlit: Interactive user interface

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains the following features:
- `age`: Age of the individual
- `gender`: Gender of the individual
- `bmi`: Body Mass Index
- `children`: Number of dependents
- `smoker`: Whether the individual smokes or not
- `region`: Geographic region
- `expenses`: Medical expenses (target variable)

**Note**: Ensure that you have permission to use the dataset if it is proprietary.
